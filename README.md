![Screenshot Timeline](screenshot.png)

## üéØ You decide how much you want to interact with the community

### üëÄ Basic: read-only

Create your [social.org](https://github.com/tanrax/org-social) file and add the followers you want to read to your list.

After, set `org-social-file` to point to your file.

```elisp
(setq org-social-file "~/social.org")
```

And run `M-x org-social-timeline` to see the timeline.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Advanced: You write, reply and read

Upload your social.org file to a web server and share the URL with others.

After setting `org-social-file`, you can create new posts with `M-x org-social-new-post` and reply to posts in the timeline with `r`.

### üåê Complete: You interact with the entire community

Set Relay configuration variables to register your feed with the Relay server and discover mentions, replies, and other social interactions.

```elisp
(setq org-social-relay "https://relay.example.com") ;; Relay server URL
(setq org-social-my-public-url "https://example.com/social.org") ;; My public URL
```

Check the [public Relay list](https://github.com/tanrax/org-social/blob/main/org-social-relay-list.txt) to find a Relay server.

            (call-process-shell-command
             (format "scp %s %s"
                     org-social-file
                     "user@server:/your/path/social.org")

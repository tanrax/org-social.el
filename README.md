## üéØ Getting Started

**Note:** The Relay server is required for org-social.el to work.

### Required Configuration

1. Create your [social.org](https://github.com/tanrax/org-social) file
2. Upload it to a web server so others can access it
3. Configure org-social.el with the required settings:

```elisp
(setq org-social-file "~/social.org")  ;; Path to your local file
(setq org-social-relay "https://org-social-relay.andros.dev/")  ;; Relay server
(setq org-social-my-public-url "https://example.com/social.org")  ;; Your public URL
```

You can use the [public Relay server](https://org-social-relay.andros.dev/) or check the [public Relay list](https://github.com/tanrax/org-social/blob/main/org-social-relay-list.txt) for other options.

### Basic Usage

- View timeline: `M-x org-social-timeline`
- Create new post: `M-x org-social-new-post`
- Reply to posts in timeline: Press `r` on a post
- Interact with the entire community through the relay server

            (call-process-shell-command
             (format "scp %s %s"
                     org-social-file

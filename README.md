## 🎯 You decide how much you want to interact with the community

### 👀 Basic: read-only

Create your [social.org](https://github.com/tanrax/org-social) file and add the followers you want to read to your list.

After, set `org-social-file` to point to your file.

```elisp
(setq org-social-file "~/social.org")
```

And run `M-x org-social-timeline` to see the timeline.

### ✍️ Advanced: You write, reply and read

Upload your social.org file to a web server and share the URL with others.

After setting `org-social-file`, you can create new posts with `M-x org-social-new-post` and reply to posts in the timeline with `r`.

### 🌐 Complete: You interact with the entire community

**Note:** The Relay server is required for org-social.el to work. Configure both your relay server and public URL:

```elisp
(setq org-social-relay "https://org-social-relay.andros.dev/") ;; Public Relay server
(setq org-social-my-public-url "https://example.com/social.org") ;; Your public URL
```

You can use the [public Relay server](https://org-social-relay.andros.dev/) or check the [public Relay list](https://github.com/tanrax/org-social/blob/main/org-social-relay-list.txt) for other options.

            (call-process-shell-command
             (format "scp %s %s"
                     org-social-file
                     "user@server:/your/path/social.org")
             nil 0)))
```

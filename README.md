## Timeline Features

The timeline displays posts with rich metadata:

- **Language** indicator in brackets `[en]`, `[es]`, etc.
- **Tags** with hashtag format `#programming #social`
- **Easy navigation** between posts with `n` and `p`
- **Quick replies** with `r` key
- **Content positioning** - navigation moves cursor to post content, not headers

Example timeline view:
```
** Alice ðŸ˜Š [es] #programming #social
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: 2025-01-15T14:30:00+0100
:END:

Does anyone know how to configure Emacs for org-social?
```

## Hooks

You can use the following hooks to perform additional actions automatically:

| Name | Description |
|------|------------|
| `org-social-after-save-file-hook` | Runs after saving the social file. Useful for automating tasks like uploading to a remote server or syncing with other services. |
| `org-social-after-fetch-posts-hook` | Runs after all feeds have been fetched and processed. |

For example, to automatically upload your social file to a remote server after saving:

```elisp
(add-hook 'org-social-after-save-file-hook
          (lambda ()
            (call-process-shell-command
             (format "scp %s %s"
                     org-social-file
                     "user@server:/your/path/social.org")
             nil 0)))
```

## Workflow

1. **Setup**: Configure `org-social-file` and create your social.org file
2. **View timeline**: Use `M-x org-social-timeline` or `C-c C-t`
3. **Navigate**: Use `n`/`p` to move between posts in the timeline
4. **Reply**: Press `r` when positioned on a post to create a reply
5. **Create posts**: Use `M-x org-social-new-post` or `C-c C-n`
6. **Save and sync**: Use `C-c C-c` to save with hooks
